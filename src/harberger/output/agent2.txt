**Your available balance is 100000. You cannot place a bid or ask that exceeds this amount.**

The signals represent market data, and you should interpret them to determine whether you wish to post a buy (bid) or sell (ask) order.

Market Signals:
- 'signals': Your private signals, visible only to you
- 'publicSignal': Signals visible to all players
Use this data to inform your decision. You are responsible for setting the prices based on these signals.

**You must ensure that the 'price' in your order does not exceed your available balance.**

Current Phase (6): Market Phase: Players now see their private signals and the public signals. Use these signals to decide your next trading move.

**Your available balance is 83427. You cannot place a bid or ask that exceeds this amount.**

The signals represent market data, and you should interpret them to determine whether you wish to post a buy (bid) or sell (ask) order.

Market Signals:
- 'signals': Your private signals, visible only to you
- 'publicSignal': Signals visible to all players
Use this data to inform your decision. You are responsible for setting the prices based on these signals.

**You must ensure that the 'price' in your order does not exceed your available balance.**

Current Phase (6): Market Phase: Players now see their private signals and the public signals. Use these signals to decide your next trading move.

**Your available balance is 77327. You cannot place a bid or ask that exceeds this amount.**

The signals represent market data, and you should interpret them to determine whether you wish to post a buy (bid) or sell (ask) order.

Market Signals:
- 'signals': Your private signals, visible only to you
- 'publicSignal': Signals visible to all players
Use this data to inform your decision. You are responsible for setting the prices based on these signals.

**You must ensure that the 'price' in your order does not exceed your available balance.**

    "type": "post-order",
    "order": {
        "price": your_chosen_price if 1 <= your_chosen_price <= 77327,  # Integer, price you decide based on signals, limited to range 1-77327

Current Phase (6): Market Phase: Players now see their private signals and the public signals. Use these signals to decide your next trading move.

**Your available balance is 77327. You cannot place a bid or ask that exceeds this amount.**

The signals represent market data, and you should interpret them to determine whether you wish to post a buy (bid) or sell (ask) order.

Market Signals:
- 'signals': Your private signals, visible only to you
- 'publicSignal': Signals visible to all players
Use this data to inform your decision. You are responsible for setting the prices based on these signals.

**You must ensure that the 'price' in your order does not exceed your available balance.**

Current Phase (6): Market Phase: Players now see their private signals and the public signals. Use these signals to decide your next trading move.

**Your available balance is 77327. You cannot place a bid or ask that exceeds this amount.**

The signals represent market data, and you should interpret them to determine whether you wish to post a buy (bid) or sell (ask) order.

Market Signals:
- 'signals': Your private signals, visible only to you
- 'publicSignal': Signals visible to all players
Use this data to inform your decision. You are responsible for setting the prices based on these signals.

**You must ensure that the 'price' in your order does not exceed your available balance.**

Current Phase (6): Market Phase: Players now see their private signals and the public signals. Use these signals to decide your next trading move.

**Your available balance is 77327. You cannot place a bid or ask that exceeds this amount.**

The signals represent market data, and you should interpret them to determine whether you wish to post a buy (bid) or sell (ask) order.

Market Signals:
- 'signals': Your private signals, visible only to you
- 'publicSignal': Signals visible to all players
Use this data to inform your decision. You are responsible for setting the prices based on these signals.

**You must ensure that the 'price' in your order does not exceed your available balance.**

Current Phase (6): Market Phase: Players now see their private signals and the public signals. Use these signals to decide your next trading move.

**Your available balance is 77327. You cannot place a bid or ask that exceeds this amount.**

The signals represent market data, and you should interpret them to determine whether you wish to post a buy (bid) or sell (ask) order.

Market Signals:
- 'signals': Your private signals, visible only to you

Use this data to inform your decision. You are responsible for setting the prices based on these signals.

**You must ensure that the 'price' in your order does not exceed your available balance.**

Current Phase (6): Market Phase: Players now see their private signals and the public signals. Use these signals to decide your next trading move.

**Your available balance is 77327. You cannot place a bid or ask that exceeds this amount.**

The signals represent market data, and you should interpret them to determine whether you wish to post a buy (bid) or sell (ask) order.

Market Signals:
- 'signals': Your private signals, visible only to you
- 'publicSignal': Signals visible to all players
Use this data to inform your decision. You are responsible for setting the prices based on these signals.

**You must ensure that the 'price' in your order does not exceed your available balance.**

Current Phase (6): Market Phase: Players now see their private signals and the public signals. Use these signals to decide your next trading move.

**Your available balance is 77327. You cannot place a bid or ask that exceeds this amount.**

The signals represent market data, and you should interpret them to determine whether you wish to post a buy (bid) or sell (ask) order.

Market Signals:
- 'signals': Your private signals, visible only to you
- 'publicSignal': Signals visible to all players
Use this data to inform your decision. You are responsible for setting the prices based on these signals.

**You must ensure that the 'price' in your order does not exceed your available balance.**

Expected JSON Output (Post Order):
{
    "gameId": 120,
    "type": "post-order",
    "order": {
        "price": your_chosen_price if 1 <= your_chosen_price <= 77327,  # Integer, price you decide based on signals, limited to range 1-77327

Current Phase (6): Market Phase: Players now see their private signals and the public signals. Use these signals to decide your next trading move.

**Your available balance is 77327. You cannot place a bid or ask that exceeds this amount.**

The signals represent market data, and you should interpret them to determine whether you wish to post a buy (bid) or sell (ask) order.

Market Signals:
- 'signals': Your private signals, visible only to you
- 'publicSignal': Signals visible to all players
Use this data to inform your decision. You are responsible for setting the prices based on these signals.

**You must ensure that the 'price' in your order does not exceed your available balance.**

Current Phase (6): Market Phase: Players now see their private signals and the public signals. Use these signals to decide your next trading move.

**Your available balance is 77327. You cannot place a bid or ask that exceeds this amount.**

The signals represent market data, and you should interpret them to determine whether you wish to post a buy (bid) or sell (ask) order.

Market Signals:
- 'signals': Your private signals, visible only to you
- 'publicSignal': Signals visible to all players
Use this data to inform your decision. You are responsible for setting the prices based on these signals.

**You must ensure that the 'price' in your order does not exceed your available balance.**

Current Phase (6): Market Phase: Players now see their private signals and the public signals. Use these signals to decide your next trading move.

**Your available balance is 77327. You cannot place a bid or ask that exceeds this amount.**

The signals represent market data, and you should interpret them to determine whether you wish to post a buy (bid) or sell (ask) order.

Market Signals:
- 'signals': Your private signals, visible only to you
- 'publicSignal': Signals visible to all players
Use this data to inform your decision. You are responsible for setting the prices based on these signals.

**You must ensure that the 'price' in your order does not exceed your available balance.**

Current Phase (6): Market Phase: Players now see their private signals and the public signals. Use these signals to decide your next trading move.

**Your available balance is 77327. You cannot place a bid or ask that exceeds this amount.**

The signals represent market data, and you should interpret them to determine whether you wish to post a buy (bid) or sell (ask) order.

Market Signals:
- 'signals': Your private signals, visible only to you
- 'publicSignal': Signals visible to all players
Use this data to inform your decision. You are responsible for setting the prices based on these signals.

**You must ensure that the 'price' in your order does not exceed your available balance.**

Current Phase (6): Market Phase: Players now see their private signals and the public signals. Use these signals to decide your next trading move.

**Your available balance is 77327. You cannot place a bid or ask that exceeds this amount.**

The signals represent market data, and you should interpret them to determine whether you wish to post a buy (bid) or sell (ask) order.

Market Signals:
- 'signals': Your private signals, visible only to you
- 'publicSignal': Signals visible to all players
Use this data to inform your decision. You are responsible for setting the prices based on these signals.

**You must ensure that the 'price' in your order does not exceed your available balance.**

    "type": "post-order",
    "order": {
        "price": your_chosen_price if 1 <= your_chosen_price <= 77327,  # Integer, price you decide based on signals, limited to range 1-77327

Current Phase (6): Market Phase: Players now see their private signals and the public signals. Use these signals to decide your next trading move.

**Your available balance is 77327. You cannot place a bid or ask that exceeds this amount.**

The signals represent market data, and you should interpret them to determine whether you wish to post a buy (bid) or sell (ask) order.

Market Signals:
- 'signals': Your private signals, visible only to you
- 'publicSignal': Signals visible to all players
Use this data to inform your decision. You are responsible for setting the prices based on these signals.

**You must ensure that the 'price' in your order does not exceed your available balance.**

Current Phase (6): Market Phase: Players now see their private signals and the public signals. Use these signals to decide your next trading move.

**Your available balance is 77327. You cannot place a bid or ask that exceeds this amount.**

The signals represent market data, and you should interpret them to determine whether you wish to post a buy (bid) or sell (ask) order.

Market Signals:
- 'signals': Your private signals, visible only to you
- 'publicSignal': Signals visible to all players
Use this data to inform your decision. You are responsible for setting the prices based on these signals.

**You must ensure that the 'price' in your order does not exceed your available balance.**

Current Phase (6): Market Phase: Players now see their private signals and the public signals. Use these signals to decide your next trading move.

**Your available balance is 77327. You cannot place a bid or ask that exceeds this amount.**

The signals represent market data, and you should interpret them to determine whether you wish to post a buy (bid) or sell (ask) order.

Market Signals:
- 'signals': Your private signals, visible only to you
- 'publicSignal': Signals visible to all players
Use this data to inform your decision. You are responsible for setting the prices based on these signals.

**You must ensure that the 'price' in your order does not exceed your available balance.**

Current Phase (6): Market Phase: Players now see their private signals and the public signals. Use these signals to decide your next trading move.

**Your available balance is 77327. You cannot place a bid or ask that exceeds this amount.**

The signals represent market data, and you should interpret them to determine whether you wish to post a buy (bid) or sell (ask) order.

Market Signals:
- 'signals': Your private signals, visible only to you
- 'publicSignal': Signals visible to all players
Use this data to inform your decision. You are responsible for setting the prices based on these signals.

**You must ensure that the 'price' in your order does not exceed your available balance.**

Current Phase (6): Market Phase: Players now see their private signals and the public signals. Use these signals to decide your next trading move.

**Your available balance is 77327. You cannot place a bid or ask that exceeds this amount.**

The signals represent market data, and you should interpret them to determine whether you wish to post a buy (bid) or sell (ask) order.

Market Signals:
- 'signals': Your private signals, visible only to you
- 'publicSignal': Signals visible to all players
Use this data to inform your decision. You are responsible for setting the prices based on these signals.

**You must ensure that the 'price' in your order does not exceed your available balance.**

Current Phase (6): Market Phase: Players now see their private signals and the public signals. Use these signals to decide your next trading move.

**Your available balance is 83527. You cannot place a bid or ask that exceeds this amount.**

The signals represent market data, and you should interpret them to determine whether you wish to post a buy (bid) or sell (ask) order.

Market Signals:
- 'signals': Your private signals, visible only to you
- 'publicSignal': Signals visible to all players
Use this data to inform your decision. You are responsible for setting the prices based on these signals.

**You must ensure that the 'price' in your order does not exceed your available balance.**

Expected JSON Output (Post Order):

    "type": "post-order",
    "order": {
        "price": your_chosen_price if 1 <= your_chosen_price <= 83527,  # Integer, price you decide based on signals, limited to range 1-83527

Your response should be in valid JSON format without any extra text, explanation, or formatting.

Events Summary:
Simulation Events Summary:
Current Phase (6): Market Phase: Players now see their private signals and the public signals. Use these signals to decide your next trading move.

**Your available balance is 600000. You cannot place a bid or ask that exceeds this amount.**

The signals represent market data, and you should interpret them to determine whether you wish to post a buy (bid) or sell (ask) order.

Market Signals:
- 'signals': Your private signals, visible only to you
- 'publicSignal': Signals visible to all players
Use this data to inform your decision. You are responsible for setting the prices based on these signals.

**You must ensure that the 'price' in your order does not exceed your available balance.**
