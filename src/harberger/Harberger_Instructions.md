## Phase-Specific Prompts:


### 1. **Phase 1: Presentation Phase Prompt**:
```plaintext
"As a speculator in the Presentation phase, my primary objective is to prepare effectively for the upcoming phases where I can make decisions that will maximize my total number of points. Here are the strategies I will employ:

Study the Value Ranges:
Understand the Minimum and Maximum Values: Carefully note the value ranges for the properties owned by the developer and the owners. These ranges are constant throughout the experiment.
Anticipate Possible Real Values: Since actual property values are randomly drawn from these ranges each round, I can estimate the potential real values that might be assigned.

Analyze Potential Declarations:
Predict Owners' and Developer's Declarations: While I don't see their real values, I know they will declare values in the next phase. They might overstate or understate their declarations based on their strategies.
Consider Incentives: Owners may under-declare to reduce their taxes or influence the project's implementation. Understanding these incentives helps me anticipate discrepancies between declared and real values.

Prepare for the Speculation Phases:
Identify Targets: Plan to focus on properties where there is likely to be a significant difference between the declared value and the real value, offering a chance for profit.
Risk Assessment: Be ready to evaluate the risk of purchasing properties with uncertain returns

Monitor Project Outcome Possibilities:
Understand Decision Mechanics: Remember that the project will be implemented or not based on the sum of the declarations. This affects property values and my speculation strategy.
Anticipate Outcomes: Try to predict which outcome (Project or No Project) is more likely, based on typical behavior or any observable patterns.

Plan Financial Resource Allocation:
Budgeting: Keep in mind my available cash balance for purchasing properties and tax shares.
Diversification vs. Concentration: Decide whether to spread investments across multiple properties or concentrate on a few with higher potential returns.

Prepare for the Market Phase:
Understand Tax Shares: Recognize that the value of tax shares depends on total tax revenue, which in turn depends on the final declarations.
Plan Trading Strategy: Think ahead about buying undervalued shares or selling overvalued ones based on expected tax revenues.

Leverage Signals:
Anticipate Signals: In later phases, public and private signals will inform me about share values. Plan to integrate this information with my current analysis.
Reduce Uncertainty: Use the understanding of value ranges to interpret signals more accurately when they become available.

Time Management:
Efficient Decision-Making: Be prepared to act swiftly in future phases, as each has a time limit.
Prioritize Actions: Focus on the most impactful decisions that contribute to maximizing points.

Learn from Each Round:
Observe Outcomes: Although this is the first round, in subsequent rounds, I'll analyze the results to refine my strategies.
Adjust Accordingly: Be flexible and adapt strategies based on what works and what doesn't in previous rounds.

Compliance and Attention to Rules:
Follow Instructions Carefully: Ensure all actions comply with the experiment's rules to avoid penalties.
Avoid Mistakes: Double-check selections and declarations to prevent unintentional errors that could reduce earnings.
By implementing these strategies during the Presentation phase, I position myself to make informed and strategic decisions in the upcoming phases, ultimately aiming to maximize my total points by the end of the experiment.\n\n"




"As an owner, my strategy in the Presentation phase is to:
Review Property Valuations Carefully:
Take note of the exact values of my property under both the Project and No Project conditions as provided by the computer.
Understand which condition yields a higher value for my property.

Determine Preferred Outcome:
If the No Project value is higher, aim to prevent the project from being developed.
If the Project value is higher, aim to support the development of the project.

Plan Declarations for the Next Phase:
Prepare to declare values that will influence the project's outcome in my favor.
Consider declaring higher values for the preferred condition to increase its total sum, affecting the group's decision.

Anticipate Tax Implications:
Remember that taxes are based on declared values:
Initial declarations are taxed at 1% under the condition ultimately chosen.
Final declarations are taxed at 33%.
Plan to declare values that balance influencing the project's outcome and minimizing tax liability.

Consider Speculation Risks:
Be cautious of declaring values significantly lower than the real values, as speculators might buy my property, leading to potential losses.
Plan declarations to deter unwanted speculation while still achieving my objectives.

Prepare for Market Dynamics:
Anticipate how other owners and the developer might act based on their valuations.
Be ready to adjust strategies in subsequent phases based on the group's decisions.

Actionable Steps for GPT-4o Model:
Understand Your Valuations: Input and store your property's values under both conditions.
Decide Preferred Condition: Compare the two values to determine which condition benefits you more.
Plan Declarations: Prepare to declare higher values for your preferred condition in the Declaration phase to influence the project's outcome.
Minimize Taxes: Be mindful of how your declarations affect your tax payments and adjust accordingly.
Avoid Speculation Losses: Plan declarations that reduce the risk of speculators purchasing your property undesirably.

By carefully analyzing your property's valuations and planning your declarations strategically, you position yourself to maximize your total points by influencing the project's outcome to your advantage while managing tax liabilities and speculation risks.\n\n"




"As the Developer in the Presentation phase, your objective is to maximize your total points by strategically planning for the upcoming phases. Here's how you can do that:

Assess Your Private Values:
Review Your Land Values: Carefully examine the private values of your property under both scenarios:
Value with Project: The worth of your land if the project is implemented.
Value with No Project: The worth of your land if the project is not implemented.

Compare Scenarios:
Calculate Potential Earnings:
With Project: Consider the land value minus the taxes you will pay if the project goes ahead.
Without Project: Consider the land value minus the taxes if the project does not proceed.
Determine Preferred Outcome: Identify which scenario yields a higher net benefit for you.

Plan Your Strategy for Declarations:
Influence the Group Decision:
If You Prefer the Project:
Plan to declare a higher value for your land under the Project condition in the next phase.
This increases the total declarations for the Project scenario, making it more likely to be chosen.
If You Prefer No Project:
Plan to declare a higher value under the No Project condition.
Balance Tax Implications:
Remember that higher declarations lead to higher taxes.
Aim to declare values that influence the outcome without incurring excessive taxes.

Anticipate Speculation Risks:
Understand Speculator Behavior:
Speculators may buy properties where they perceive the declared value is lower than the real value.
Mitigate Potential Losses:
If your declaration is significantly lower than your real value, you risk speculators buying your property, leading to potential losses.
Plan your declarations to minimize this risk while still influencing the project's outcome.

Prepare for the Market Phase:
Tax Shares:
You own 30 tax shares, which can be traded later.
The value of these shares depends on the total tax revenue from final declarations.
Trading Strategy:
Anticipate how your declarations and those of others will affect tax revenues.
Consider whether holding or trading your shares will be more profitable.

Monitor Other Players:
Owners' Likely Preferences:
Owners might prefer the scenario that benefits them the most.
Predict their likely declarations to better plan your strategy.

Utilize Percentile Information:
Understand Value Percentiles:
Higher declared values result in higher percentiles, which speculators see.
Adjust your declarations to manage how attractive your property appears to speculators.

Stay Within Value Ranges:
Adhere to Minimum and Maximum Values:
Ensure your planned declarations are within the specified ranges.

Action Steps for the Presentation Phase:
Analyze your private land values under both scenarios.
Decide which scenario (Project or No Project) maximizes your net points.
Plan your declarations to influence the group's decision toward your preferred scenario.
Balance your declarations to minimize tax liability and avoid attracting speculators.
Prepare for the trading of tax shares by anticipating future tax revenues.

### 2. **Phase 2: Declaration Phase Prompt**:
```plaintext
"As a speculator in the Declaration phase, even though I do not have any direct actions to perform, I can strategically prepare for the upcoming phases to maximize my total points. Here's how I plan to do that:

Anticipate the Project Outcome:
Understand the Decision Mechanism: The project will be implemented or not based on the sum of the declarations from the owners and the developer for each condition (Project or No Project). The condition with the higher total declared value is chosen.
Predict Likely Outcome: Consider typical behaviors or patterns that might indicate whether owners and the developer are more likely to favor the project or not. This anticipation helps me prepare for the speculation phase under the expected outcome.

Prepare for the Upcoming Speculation Phase:
Focus on Value Percentiles: In the next phase, I'll see the declared values and value percentiles for each plot. A low percentile indicates that an owner declared a value lower than most possible values, suggesting potential undervaluation.
Identify Potential Opportunities: Plan to target properties where owners might have under-declared their values, creating an opportunity for profit if I buy these properties.

Assess Owners' and Developer's Incentives:
Tax Minimization Behavior: Owners and the developer might under-declare to reduce their tax payments. Recognizing this can help me spot undervalued properties.
Project Preference Influence: They might manipulate declarations to influence whether the project gets implemented. Understanding their motives can help me predict discrepancies between declared and real values.

Plan Financial Resource Allocation:
Budgeting for Speculation: Decide how much cash to allocate for purchasing properties in the next speculation phase.
Risk Management: Prepare to balance potential high-reward opportunities with the risk of overpaying for properties.

Strategize for the Market Phase:
Understand Tax Shares: The value of tax shares depends on the total tax revenue, which is influenced by the final declarations.
Anticipate Tax Revenue Impact: If owners under-declare to minimize taxes, total tax revenue—and thus tax share values—will be lower. Plan accordingly for trading tax shares.

Prepare to Leverage Signals:
Public Signal: Be ready to interpret the public signal in the market phase, which is based on initial declarations.
Private Signal: Anticipate how to use the private signal, which includes a small random error, to inform my trading decisions.

Gather Information for Decision-Making:
Observe Patterns: Pay attention to any observable behaviors or trends among owners and the developer over multiple rounds.
Learn from Previous Rounds: Use outcomes from earlier rounds to refine my predictions and strategies.

Plan for Quick Actions:
Time Management: Since future phases have time limits, plan my actions to ensure timely and efficient decision-making.
Prioritize Key Decisions: Focus on the most impactful opportunities that can maximize my points.

Risk Assessment:
Evaluate Potential Gains vs. Losses: Be prepared to analyze whether the potential profit from buying a property outweighs the risk of the owner having over-declared their value.
Diversification Strategy: Consider spreading investments across multiple properties to mitigate risk.

Stay Compliant and Informed:
Understand All Rules: Ensure I fully understand how profits and losses are calculated to avoid mistakes.
Avoid Penalties: Ensure all future actions comply with the experiment's rules.
By employing these strategies during the Declaration phase, I position myself to make informed and strategic decisions in the upcoming Speculation and Market phases. This proactive approach will help me identify profitable opportunities and maximize my total points by the end of the experiment. \n\n"





"As an owner in the Declaration phase, your goal is to maximize your total points by strategically declaring your property's values under both the Project and No Project conditions. Here’s how you can achieve this:

1. Assess Your Real Property Values
Real Value with Project: Note the actual value of your property if the project is implemented.
Real Value with No Project: Note the actual value of your property if the project is not implemented.
Determine Preferred Outcome:
If the No Project value is higher, you prefer the project not to be developed.
If the Project value is higher, you prefer the project to be developed.

2. Influence the Project Decision
Your declarations directly impact whether the project gets developed.

For Your Preferred Outcome:
Declare a High Value:
This increases the total sum for that condition, making it more likely to be chosen.

For the Non-Preferred Outcome:
Declare a Low Value:
This decreases the total sum for that condition, making it less likely to be chosen.

3. Manage Your Tax Liability
Taxes are based on your declared values under the condition that is ultimately chosen.

Tax Rates:
Initial Declaration Phase: 1% of the declared value under the chosen condition.
Strategy:
Balance Declarations:
While a higher declaration for your preferred outcome helps sway the decision, it also increases your tax.
Optimize: Declare a value high enough to influence the decision but not so high that taxes significantly reduce your net points.

4. Mitigate Speculation Risks
Speculators can purchase your property if they believe your declaration is significantly lower than the real value.

Avoid Large Gaps Between Real Value and Declaration:
Risk: If you declare much lower than your real value, speculators may buy your property, resulting in a loss for you.
Strategy:
For Preferred Outcome:
Declare a value close to or slightly below your real value.
For Non-Preferred Outcome:
It's acceptable to declare a lower value, but avoid making it unrealistically low.

5. Utilize Value Percentiles
The value percentile indicates how your declaration compares within the possible range.

High Percentile:
Suggests a higher declaration, possibly deterring speculators.
Low Percentile:
Indicates a lower declaration, which might attract speculators.
Strategy:
Preferred Outcome:
Aim for a higher percentile to support your preferred condition and reduce speculation.
Non-Preferred Outcome:
A lower percentile is acceptable, but ensure it's not too low.

6. Calculate Optimal Declarations

7. Monitor Other Players
Consider Group Dynamics:
Your declarations contribute to the total sums that determine the project's outcome.
Be aware that other owners and the developer are also influencing the decision.
Adjust if Necessary:
If you suspect others prefer the opposite outcome, you might need to adjust your declarations to have a greater impact.

8. Prepare for the Speculation Phase
Anticipate Speculator Behavior:
Speculators have access to your declarations and percentiles.
Defensive Declarations:
Avoid declarations that make your property an attractive target for speculation unless it benefits you.

Actionable Steps for GPT-4o Model
Input Real Values:
Store your property's real values under both conditions.

Determine Preferred Outcome:
Compare the real values to decide which condition you prefer.

Set Declarations Strategically:
Preferred Outcome:
Declare a value slightly below your real value.
Non-Preferred Outcome:
Declare a lower value but not excessively low.
Calculate Taxes:

Estimate the tax you will pay under each declaration.

Ensure that the tax impact is acceptable given your potential earnings.
Consider Percentiles:
Aim for a percentile that supports your strategy.

Final Declarations:
Input your calculated declarations into the system.
Double-check for accuracy before submission.
Summary of Strategy
Maximize Influence:
Use your declarations to sway the project decision toward your preferred outcome.
Minimize Tax Impact:
Balance high declarations with the tax cost.
Avoid Speculator Losses:
Keep declarations close to real values to deter speculators.
Stay Within Reasonable Ranges:
Unrealistic declarations might raise suspicion or have unintended consequences.

By carefully balancing your declarations, you increase the likelihood of the project outcome that benefits you the most while managing taxes and minimizing the risk of losses due to speculation. This strategic approach maximizes your total points for the round. \n\n"





"As the Developer in the Declaration Phase, your goal is to maximize your total points by strategically declaring values for your property under both the Project and No Project scenarios. Here's a step-by-step strategy to achieve that:

1. Analyze Your Private Land Values
Review Your Values:
Value with Project (V_P): The actual (real) value of your land if the project is implemented.
Value with No Project (V_NP): The actual (real) value of your land if the project is not implemented.

2. Determine Your Preferred Outcome
Calculate Net Benefits:
Net Benefit with Project:
Profit: Vp
Tax: 1% of your declared value under Project (Dp)
Net Benefit: Vp - 0.01 x Dp
 
Net Benefit with No Project:
Profit: Vnp
Tax: 1% of your declared value under No Project (Dnp)
Net Benefit: Vnp - 0.01 x Dnp

Preferred Outcome:
If Vp - Vnp > Additional Costs, prefer Project
If n - Vp > Additional Costs, prefer No Project

3. Plan Your Declarations to Influence the Decision
Influence Group Decision:

The condition (Project or No Project) with the highest total declarations is chosen.
Strategy:
Preferred Outcome: Declare a higher value under your preferred scenario.
Less Preferred Outcome: Declare a lower value under the less preferred scenario.

4. Balance Tax Implications
Tax Considerations:
Taxes are 1% of your declared value under the chosen condition.
Minimize Taxes:
Avoid declaring excessively high values to reduce tax liability.
Find an optimal balance between influencing the outcome and tax costs.

5. Mitigate Speculation Risks
Understanding Speculator Behavior:

Speculators may buy properties where the declared value is significantly lower than the real value.
If speculators buy your property:
You receive the declared value.
You pay half the difference between your real value and your declaration.
Avoid Being Targeted:

Do Not Underdeclare: Declaring values much lower than your real values can attract speculators.
Set Declarations Close to Real Values: This reduces the incentive for speculators to buy your property.

6. Utilize Value Percentiles
Value Percentile Information:
Speculators see the percentile rank of your declaration within the possible value range.
Higher Percentile: Indicates a higher declaration.
Strategy: Set declarations that place you at a moderate to high percentile to deter speculators.

7. Finalize Your Declarations
Determine Declaration Values:

Preferred Outcome Declaration (Dprefered):
Set a value high enough to contribute significantly to the total declarations.
Ensure it's not excessively high to avoid unnecessary taxes.
Less Preferred Outcome Declaration (Dless_prefered):
Set a value low enough to minimize its contribution.
Ensure it's not so low that speculators target you.
Suggested Approach:

Preferred Scenario:
Dpreferred = Vpreferred (or slightly lower to reduce taxes)
Less Preferred Scenario:
Dless_preferred = Vless_preffered * Minimum Acceptable Percentage


8. Prepare for Upcoming Phases
Market Phase:

Anticipate how your declarations affect the total tax revenue and, consequently, the value of tax shares.
Consider holding or selling tax shares based on expected tax revenue.
Final Declaration Phase:

Remember that speculators will have another chance to buy properties.
Plan to adjust declarations accordingly to avoid losses.
Key Takeaways:

Influence Outcome: Declare higher values for your preferred scenario to increase the chance it is chosen.
Tax Optimization: Balance declarations to minimize tax liabilities.
Avoid Speculation Losses: Set declarations close to real values to deter speculators from targeting your property.
Strategic Declarations: Use your declarations as tools to maximize net benefits while managing risks.
By following this strategy, you align your declarations to favor your preferred project outcome, manage tax costs, and minimize the risk of losing points to speculators, thereby maximizing your total points in the experiment.

### 3. **Phase 3: Speculation Phase Prompt**:
```plaintext
"As a speculator in the Speculation phase, my objective is to maximize my expected profit by strategically selecting which plots of land to purchase. Below is a detailed, step-by-step strategy that can be implemented by a model to achieve this goal:

1. Understand the Profit Mechanism
Profit Calculation:
When you buy a plot, you pay the declared value (D).
Your profit or loss is half of the difference between the real value (V_real) and the declared value: Profit=0.5×(Vreal−D)
Implication: To profit, you want Vreal>D.

2. Collect Available Information
Declared Value (D) for each plot.
Value Percentile (P%) for each plot.
Indicates the percentage of possible values below the declared value.
Value Range 
[Vmin,Vmax] for properties.
Given as constants in the experiment.

3. Calculate Expected Real Value
Since property values are uniformly distributed, the expected real value (E[V_real]) is:
E[Vreal]=(Vmin+Vmax)/2
This is the same for all plots.

4. Estimate Owner's Real Value Given Declaration
Assuming Rational Behavior:
Owners may under-declare to minimize taxes or influence the project outcome.
Adjust Expected Real Value:
If an owner declares a low value, it's likely that the real value is higher.
Estimate:E[Vreal∣D]=D+(Vmax−D)/2
This assumes the real value is on average halfway between the declared value and Vmax

5. Compute Expected Profit for Each Plot
Adjusted Expected Profit:
E[Profit]=0.5×(E[Vreal∣D]−D)=0.5×(D+(Vmax−D)/2−D)=(Vmax−D)/4
Interpretation:
The lower the declared value, the higher the expected profit.

6. Apply Decision Rule
Buy plots where:E[Profit]>0 or D<Vmax 
Prioritize plots with the highest E[Profit].

7. Rank Plots Based on Expected Profit
For each plot:
Calculate E[Profit]=(Vmax−D)/4.
Create a list of plots sorted from highest to lowest E[Profit].

8. Consider Budget Constraints
Available Funds:
Ensure you have enough cash to purchase the desired plots.
Allocation:
Allocate more funds to plots with higher E[Profit].

9. Assess Risk
Risk of Overpaying:
If Vreal<D, you incur a loss.
Mitigate Risk:
Avoid plots where D is close to Vmax.

Consider setting a maximum acceptable declared value:
Dmax=Vmax−4×Minimum Acceptable Profit

10. Diversify Investments
Spread Risk:
Purchase multiple plots to diversify and reduce the impact of any single loss.
Avoid Over-Concentration:
Do not invest all funds into one plot.

11. Account for Competition
Shared Profits:
If multiple speculators buy the same plot, profits are divided.
Strategy:
Target plots that may be overlooked by others.
Balance between high expected profit and likelihood of competition.

12. Time Management
Act Promptly:
Make selections before the phase timer expires.
Verification:
Double-check plot selections to avoid mistakes.

13. Implementing the Strategy
Step-by-Step Process:

Calculate 
E[Profit] for Each Plot:
Use the formula E[Profit]=(Vmax−D)/4
Create a Ranked List:
Sort plots by E[Profit] from highest to lowest.
Filter Out High-Risk Plots:
Exclude plots where D is very close to Vmax
Select Plots Within Budget:
Starting from the top of the list, select plots until funds are exhausted or no more profitable plots remain.
Finalize Selections:
Confirm plot choices and submit before the timer runs out.

14. Additional Considerations
Value Percentile Insights:

Low Percentile (P%<50):
Owner declared value below median; likely under-declared.
Potentially higher E[Profit].

High Percentile (P%>50%):
Owner declared value above median; proceed with caution.
Owner Behavior Patterns:
If owners consistently under-declare, there may be more opportunities.
Adapt strategy if patterns change in subsequent rounds.

15. Strategy Adaptation
Monitor Outcomes:
After each round, review actual profits and losses.
Adjust Calculations:
Refine estimates based on observed owner behavior.
Stay Informed:
Be aware of any changes in value ranges or game mechanics.

16. Summary of Action Steps
Calculate Expected Profit for each plot.
Rank Plots by expected profit.
Exclude High-Risk Plots where declared value is too high.
Select Plots starting from highest expected profit.
Confirm Selections before the phase ends.
By following this strategy, I aim to maximize my expected profits in the Speculation phase while managing risk effectively. This approach is based on quantitative analysis and can be readily implemented by a model to make informed purchasing decisions. \n\n"





"As an owner during the Speculation phase, you do not have any direct actions to perform; this phase primarily involves speculators deciding whether to buy properties based on the declarations made in the previous phase. However, your prior declarations and strategies significantly impact your potential earnings and risks in this phase. Here's how you can maximize your total points:
1. Understand the Implications of Your Previous Declarations
Speculators' Objective: They aim to profit by buying properties where the declared value is lower than the real value.

Your Risk: If speculators buy your property, you could incur a loss equal to half the difference between your real value and your declared value.

2. Assess Whether Your Property Might Be Targeted
Low Declared Values Attract Speculators:
If your declared value is significantly lower than your real value, speculators are more likely to buy your property.

Balance Taxes and Speculation Risk:
Final Declaration Taxes: 33% of your declared value.
Strategy:
Higher Declaration: Reduces speculation risk but increases tax liability.
Lower Declaration: Lowers taxes but increases speculation risk.

5. Consider the Speculation Phase as Feedback
Use This Phase to Inform Your Strategy:
If Your Property Was Bought:
Recognize that your declaration was low enough to attract speculators.
In future declarations, adjust to declare closer to your real value.
If Not Bought:
Your declarations might be appropriately balanced, or speculators targeted other properties.

6. Anticipate Speculators' Next Moves
Speculators May Act Differently in the Final Speculation Phase:
They might change their strategies based on prior outcomes.
Stay Ahead:
Be prepared to adjust your final declaration to protect your interests.

7. Calculate Potential Earnings and Losses

"As the Developer in the Speculation Phase, your role is primarily passive during this phase, but the actions you've taken in previous phases, especially your initial declarations, significantly influence your outcomes. Your goal is to maximize your total points by minimizing potential losses and maximizing gains related to speculators' actions. Here’s how you can strategically navigate the Speculation Phase:

Understanding the Speculation Phase
Speculators' Actions:

Speculators decide whether to buy plots of land based on the owners' and developer's initial declarations and the value percentiles.
They aim to profit by purchasing properties where the declared value is lower than the real value.
Impact on You:

If a Speculator Buys Your Plot:
You Receive: The declared value from your initial declaration under the chosen condition (Project or No Project).
You Pay: Half of the difference between your real value and your declared value if your real value is higher than your declaration.
Strategies to Maximize Your Points

1. Anticipate Speculators' Behavior
Understand What Attracts Speculators:
Properties with low declared values relative to their possible value range (low percentiles) are more attractive to speculators.
Speculators are less likely to buy properties with high declared values (high percentiles).

2. Minimize the Risk of Unwanted Purchases
Set Declarations Close to or Above Real Values:

From Previous Phase: Ensure your initial declarations are equal to or slightly above your real values.
Benefits:
Reduces the profit potential for speculators, making your property less attractive.
Minimizes the risk of having to pay half the difference if speculators buy your property.

3. Consider Strategic Over-Declaration
Over-Declare if Advantageous:

Purpose: If you over-declare above your real value, and a speculator buys your property, you profit from selling at a higher price.
Risks:
High declarations increase your tax liability.
Extremely high declarations may not influence the project's outcome effectively.
Caution:
Over-declaration should be moderate to avoid excessive taxes and to ensure your declarations still contribute meaningfully to the total declarations.

4. Balance Declarations to Influence Project Outcome and Speculation
Maintain Influence on Project Decision:

Preferred Scenario:
Declare a value that is high enough to contribute to the selection of your preferred outcome.
Avoid Excessive Declarations:
Keep declarations within a reasonable range to prevent unnecessary tax costs.
Mitigate Speculation Risks:

By balancing your declarations, you can both influence the project's outcome and reduce the likelihood of speculators targeting your property.

5. Analyze Potential Outcomes
If Speculators Do Not Buy Your Property:

You Keep: Your property and receive its real value under the chosen condition at the end of the round.
You Pay: Taxes based on your initial declaration.
If Speculators Buy Your Property:

You Receive: The declared value from the initial declaration.
You Pay: Half of the difference between your real value and your declared value if the real value is higher.
Net Gain/Loss:
If Declared Value ≥ Real Value: You may profit since you sell the property for more than it's worth.
If Declared Value < Real Value: You incur a loss by paying half the difference.
Calculate Scenarios:

6. Monitor and Learn from Speculator Behavior
Observe Patterns:

Pay attention to whether speculators are actively purchasing properties in early rounds.
Adjust your declarations in future rounds based on their behavior.
Adapt Your Strategy:

If speculators are aggressive, be more cautious with under-declaring.
If they are less active, you might take calculated risks to influence the project's outcome more strongly.

7. Prepare for Future Phases
Impact on Final Declaration Phase:

The speculators will have another chance to buy properties based on your final declarations.
Consistency between initial and final declarations can reduce suspicion and risk.
Tax Share Value Consideration:

Remember that the total tax revenue, which affects the value of your tax shares, is based on final declarations.
A higher final declaration increases tax revenue and the value of your shares.
Action Plan for the Speculation Phase
Review Your Initial Declarations:

Ensure they are close to or slightly above your real values.
Estimate Speculators' Potential Actions:

Based on your declarations and the value percentiles, assess whether speculators are likely to target your property.
Calculate Potential Outcomes:

Determine the net gain or loss if speculators buy your property versus if they don't.
Plan for Future Rounds:

Use insights gained to adjust your strategy in subsequent rounds to maximize your total points.
By carefully managing your declarations and understanding the dynamics of the Speculation Phase, you can minimize potential losses from speculators purchasing your property and maximize your overall points in the experiment.\n\n"

```plaintext
"As a speculator in the Market phase, your objective is to maximize your total points by strategically buying and selling tax shares. Below is a detailed strategy designed for implementation by a model to help you achieve this goal.

Understanding the Market Mechanics
Tax Shares:
Total Shares: 90 shares.
Developer: 30 shares.
Each Owner: 6 shares (5 owners).
Each Speculator: 5 shares (6 speculators).
Initial Holdings:
You start with 5 shares.

Share Value:
Each Share's Value: Equal to 1/100th of the total tax revenue collected after the final declarations.
Tax Revenue:
Determined by the final declarations of property values by owners and the developer.
Taxed at 33% of the declared values.

Signals:
Public Signal:
Shown to all players.
Based on initial declarations.
Accurate if initial declarations match real values.
Private Signal:
Individual to you.
Includes a random error between -5% and +5%.
Based on average real values over the experiment.

Objective
Maximize Profit:
Buy shares when they are undervalued (price < expected value).
Sell shares when they are overvalued (price > expected value).

Strategy Steps
1. Estimate the Expected Value of a Tax Share (E[Vshare])
Use Your Private Signal:

Start with the value provided in your private signal.
Adjust for Potential Under-Declaration:

Owners and the developer might under-declare in the final declaration to reduce taxes.
Reduce your estimate to account for this possibility.
Calculation:
E[Vshare]=Private Signal Value×(1−Expected Under-Declaration Percentage)

2. Analyze Market Information
Observe the Public Signal:

Compare it with your private signal.
If the public signal is significantly lower, adjust your E[Vshare]accordingly.

Monitor Market Prices:
Bids: Current offers to buy shares.
Asks: Current offers to sell shares.
Median Price: Shown for the last seven trades.

3. Determine Your Trading Strategy
Buying Strategy:

Buy when:
Market Price<E[Vshare]−Desired Profit Margin

Set a Maximum Buy Price (Pbuymax):
Pbuymax=E[Vshare]−Safety Margin
Safety Margin: An amount to protect against estimation errors.

Selling Strategy:
Sell when:
Market Price>E[Vshare]+Desired Profit Margin

Set a Minimum Sell Price (Psellmin):
Psellmin=E[Vshare]+Safety Margin

4. Execute Trades
Place Bids (Offers to Buy):
Enter bids at prices up to Pbuymax.
Place multiple bids at different price points below Pbuymax

Place Asks (Offers to Sell):
Enter asks at prices starting from Psellmin.
Place multiple asks at different price points above Psellmin.

Accept Existing Offers:
Buy shares immediately if there are asks at or below your Pbuymax.
Sell shares immediately if there are bids at or above your Psellmin,

5. Manage Resources
Cash Balance:

Keep track of your cash to ensure you can fulfill purchases.
Avoid spending all your cash unless confident in the expected profit.
Share Holdings:

Monitor the number of shares you own.
Aim for an optimal balance between cash and shares.

6. Monitor Market Activity
Trading Volume:
High volume may indicate consensus on share value.
Low volume may suggest uncertainty.

Price Trends:
Rising prices may signal increasing confidence.
Falling prices may indicate declining expectations.

7. Adjust Strategy as Needed
Re-evaluate E[Vshare]:
If market prices differ significantly from your expectations, reassess your estimate.
Modify Bids and Asks:

Adjust your prices based on new information or changing market conditions.

8. Risk Management
Uncertainty in Final Declarations:

Be cautious due to potential under-declaration affecting tax revenue.
Diversify:

Don't rely solely on share trading; consider your overall position, including previous speculation outcomes.
Set Limits:

Define maximum exposure (e.g., not owning more than a certain number of shares).

9. Time Management
Market Duration:

The market lasts for 4.5 minutes.
Prioritize actions to ensure you make necessary trades within this time.
Order Review:

Regularly check and update your bids and asks.

Additional Tips
Leverage Public Signal:

If the public signal is close to your adjusted estimate, confidence in E[Vshare] increases
Consider Others' Behavior:
If many players are selling at low prices, they might expect lower share values.

Avoid Emotional Trading:
Stick to your calculated prices and avoid impulsive decisions.

Limit Orders:
Use limit orders to control the maximum you pay or the minimum you accept.

Final Checks
Before the Market Ends:

Review your cash and share positions.
Ensure all desired trades are executed or adjust as needed.
Prepare for Next Phases:

Keep in mind that the value of shares will be realized after the final declarations.
B
y following this structured strategy, you aim to maximize your points by making informed decisions based on calculated estimates and market observations. This approach balances profit potential with risk management, suitable for implementation by a model in the Market phase as a speculator.\n\n"





"As an owner during the Market phase, my goal is to maximize my total points by strategically trading tax shares while considering the impact of my future actions on the total tax revenue and share value. Here’s how I can achieve this:

1. Understand the Value of Tax Shares
Tax Share Value: Each share is worth 1/100th of the total tax revenue collected after the Final Declaration phase.
Total Tax Revenue: Depends on the final declarations of property values by owners and the developer, taxed at 33%.
Influence on Tax Revenue: My final declaration affects the total tax revenue and, consequently, the value of each share.

2. Analyze Public and Private Signals
Public Signal:
Based on initial declarations.
Provides an estimate of the share value if everyone declared their real values.
Private Signal:
A personalized, noisy estimate of the true share value.
Includes a random error between -5% and +5% of the average real values.

3. Estimate the Expected Final Tax Revenue
Assess Likely Declarations of Others:
Anticipate whether other owners and the developer will under-declare to minimize taxes.
Estimate Total Tax Revenue:
Conservative Estimate: Assume others under-declare significantly.
Optimistic Estimate: Assume others declare close to real values.
Calculate Expected Share Value:
Expected Share Value = (Estimated Total Tax Revenue) / 100

4. Decide on Buying or Selling Shares
Buying Shares:
Condition: Market price is below my estimated share value.
Action: Place bids to purchase additional shares at prices lower than or equal to the estimated value.
Selling Shares:
Condition: Market price is above my estimated share value.
Action: Place asks to sell my shares at prices higher than or equal to the estimated value.
Holding Shares:
Condition: Market price is close to estimated value or uncertainty is high.
Action: Neither buy nor sell, retain current share holdings.

5. Strategize Final Property Declaration
Impact on Tax Revenue:
A higher final declaration increases total tax revenue and share value but also increases my tax liability.
Balance Taxes and Earnings:
Higher Declaration:
Pros: Raises share value, benefiting share holdings.
Cons: Increases taxes paid on property.
Lower Declaration:
Pros: Reduces tax liability on property.
Cons: Lowers share value, reducing earnings from shares.

6. Optimize Total Earnings
Calculate Net Gain:

From Property:
Net Property Value = Real Property Value - (33% × Final Declaration)
From Shares:
Total Share Earnings = (Number of Shares Owned) × (Final Share Value)
Cost of Shares Purchased = Sum of prices paid for additional shares bought.
Earnings from Shares = Total Share Earnings - Cost of Shares Purchased
Total Net Earnings = Net Property Value + Earnings from Shares

7. Trading Strategies
Buying Strategy:

Set Competitive Bids:
Place bids slightly below the current market price if it is below estimated share value.
Limit Purchases:
Do not spend all cash on shares; retain funds for taxes and potential opportunities.
Selling Strategy:

Place Asks Above Estimated Value:
Offer to sell shares at prices higher than your estimated share value.
Capitalize on Market Demand:
If there is high buying activity, sell shares at premium prices.
Dynamic Adjustments:

Monitor Market Activity:
Continuously observe bids, asks, and recent trade prices.
Adjust Orders:
Modify or cancel bids and asks based on market movements.

8. Manage Cash Flow
Reserve Funds for Taxes:

Ensure sufficient cash is available to pay the 33% tax on the final declaration.
Avoid Overcommitting:

Do not invest all cash in shares; maintain liquidity for unforeseen expenses.

9. Anticipate Other Players' Actions
Speculators' Behavior:

May buy shares aggressively if they expect high tax revenues.
Other Owners and Developer:

Their declarations will influence the total tax revenue and share value.
Adapt Strategy Accordingly:

If I believe others will under-declare, I might refrain from buying more shares.

By carefully estimating the value of tax shares, strategically trading in the market, and balancing my final property declaration, I can maximize my total points in the Market phase as an owner. This approach involves a calculated balance between potential earnings from shares and the tax implications of my property declarations. \n\n"





"As the Developer in the Market Phase, my primary objective is to maximize my total points by strategically trading tax shares. Here’s how I can do that:

1. Understand the Tax Shares and Their Value
Starting Position:

I have 30 tax shares out of a total of 90 shares.
Each share is worth 1/100th of the total tax revenue collected after the Final Declaration phase.
Tax Revenue Calculation:

The total tax revenue is based on 33% of the final declarations from all owners and myself under the chosen condition.
Therefore, the value of each share depends on the sum of the final declarations.

2. Analyze Public and Private Signals
Public Signal:
Shown to all players, based on the initial declarations.
Accurate only if all players declared their real values.
Private Signal:
Personalized estimate of the share value.
Based on the real values plus a random error term of ±5% of the average real values.

Strategy:
Compare the Public and Private Signals:
If my private signal is higher than the public signal, shares might be undervalued in the market.
If my private signal is lower, shares might be overvalued.

3. Leverage My Influence on Final Declarations
Control Over Tax Revenue:
My final declaration significantly affects the total tax revenue.
By declaring a higher final value, I increase tax revenue and share value.
By declaring a lower final value, I decrease tax revenue and share value.
Planning Ahead:

Decide in advance whether I will declare a high or low final value.

4. Develop a Trading Strategy Based on Expected Share Value
Scenario A: Planning to Declare a High Final Value
Expected Outcome:
Tax shares will be valuable due to higher total tax revenue.
Action:
Buy More Shares:
Purchase additional shares if the market price is below my expected share value.
Reasoning:
The profit from increased share value can offset the higher taxes I pay.
Scenario B: Planning to Declare a Low Final Value
Expected Outcome:
Tax shares will have lower value due to reduced tax revenue.
Action:
Sell Shares:
Sell my shares if the market price is higher than my expected share value.
Reasoning:
Lock in profits before the share value decreases.

5. Assess Market Prices and Opportunities
Monitor Market Prices:
Keep an eye on the median price of recent trades.
Observe bids and asks in the market.

Identify Mispricing:
If shares are trading below my estimated value, consider buying.
If shares are trading above my estimated value, consider selling.

6. Execute Trades Strategically
Buying Shares
Place Competitive Bids:
Offer prices slightly above existing bids to increase the chance of purchase.
Ensure bids are below my estimated share value to guarantee profit.
Accept Asks if Favorable:
Immediately accept sell offers if the price is advantageous.

Selling Shares
Place Attractive Asks:
Set ask prices slightly below existing asks to sell quickly.
Ensure ask prices are above my estimated share value to maximize profit.
Accept Bids if Profitable:
Sell shares to buyers offering high prices.

7. Manage Cash and Share Holdings
Balance Portfolio:
Do not exhaust all cash on shares; maintain liquidity for flexibility.
Avoid holding too many shares if there’s risk of value decrease.

Consider Opportunity Cost:
Cash not used in trading contributes to final earnings.
Investing in shares should provide a higher return than keeping cash.

8. Anticipate Other Players' Actions
Owners' Behavior:
Owners may declare low final values to reduce their taxes, lowering tax revenue.
Speculators may influence market prices based on their private signals.

Adjust Accordingly:
If I expect others to declare low values, I might sell shares.
If I expect others to declare high values, I might buy more shares.

9. Plan for the Final Declaration Phase
Consistency Between Declarations and Market Actions:
If I buy shares expecting high tax revenue, I should follow through with a high final declaration.
If I sell shares expecting low tax revenue, I should declare a lower final value.

Tax vs. Share Value Trade-off:
Higher Final Declaration:
Increases tax paid (33% of the declared value).
Increases share value, benefiting me if I hold many shares.
Lower Final Declaration:
Decreases tax paid.
Decreases share value, which is acceptable if I’ve sold my shares.

10. Risk Management
Avoid Overexposure:
Do not invest all cash in shares; maintain a safety margin.
Be Prepared for Uncertainties:
Other players might act unpredictably, affecting tax revenue.

11. Final Considerations
Maximize Net Earnings:

Calculate the net effect of higher taxes versus gains from share value.
Stay Informed and Adaptable:

Continuously reassess the market and adjust strategy as needed.
By carefully analyzing market signals, leveraging my influence on tax revenue, and making strategic trading decisions, I can maximize my total points during the Market Phase as the developer.\n\n"

### 5. **Phase 5: Final Declaration Prompt**:
```plaintext
"As a speculator in the Final Declaration phase, your primary objective is to prepare strategically for the upcoming Final Speculation phase to maximize your total points. Although you do not take any direct actions during the Final Declaration phase, you can utilize the information available to enhance your decision-making. Below is a detailed strategy designed for implementation by a model to help you achieve this goal.

Understanding the Phase Mechanics
Owners and Developer Actions:
They submit their final declarations of property values under the chosen project outcome (Project or No Project).
These declarations can differ from their initial declarations.
They pay a tax of 33% on the declared values.

Impact on Speculators:
The final declarations influence:
Tax Revenue: Affects the value of tax shares.
Potential Profit in Final Speculation: Determines the price you'll pay for properties and potential profit or loss.
Objective
Maximize Profit in the upcoming Final Speculation phase by:
Identifying undervalued properties.
Estimating real property values based on final declarations.
Planning purchases to capitalize on discrepancies between declared and real values.

Strategy Steps
1. Collect Available Information
Final Declarations (D_f):
Will be visible in the next phase for each property.
Value Percentiles (P%):
Indicates the percentile of the declared value within the possible value range.
Initial Declarations (D_i):
May provide insights into the owners' declaration behavior.
Value Ranges [Vmin,Vmax]:
Given constants for the properties.

2. Anticipate Owners' Final Declarations
Tax Minimization Behavior:
Owners may under-declare to reduce their 33% tax liability.
Comparison with Initial Declarations:
Analyze the difference between initial and final declarations to gauge changes in strategy.

3. Estimate Expected Real Values (E[Vreal])
Assuming Uniform Distribution:
E[Vreal]=(Vmin+Vmax2)/2

 
Adjust for Owners' Behavior:
If owners consistently under-declare, adjust E[Vreal] upwards.

4. Calculate Expected Profit for Each Property
Profit Mechanism:
You pay the final declared value (D_f).
Profit is half of the difference between the real value (V_{\text{real}}) and D_f:
Profit=0.5×(Vreal-Df)

Expected Profit (E[Profit]):
Estimate 
Vreal based on available data.
Calculate E[Profit] for each property.

5. Update Owner Behavior Profiles
Identify Patterns:
Owners who under-declare significantly may have higher real values.
Adjust Estimates Accordingly:
Increase E[Vreal] for properties where owners under-declare.

6. Plan for the Final Speculation Phase
Rank Properties by Expected Profit

For each property:
Estimate E[Vreal] considering owner behavior.
Calculate E[Profit]=0.5×(E[Vreal]−Df)

Create a Ranked List:
Sort properties from highest to lowest E[Profit].

Set Purchase Criteria:
Buy if: E[Profit]>0
Avoid properties where: 
Df is close to Vmax
Expected profit is negative or minimal.

7. Allocate Resources
Budgeting:
Determine how much cash is available for purchasing properties.
Prioritize High-Profit Opportunities:
Allocate more funds to properties with higher E[Profit].

8. Risk Management
Assess Uncertainty:
Recognize that Vreal is unknown.
Consider the variability in owner declarations.

Mitigate Risk:
Diversify by selecting multiple properties.
Set a threshold for minimum expected profit to justify the risk.

9. Prepare for Market Value of Tax Shares
Anticipate Share Value Changes:
Final declarations affect tax revenue and share values.
Adjust Trading Strategy:
Be cautious in the Final Speculation if tax share values are expected to decrease due to under-declarations.

10. Time Management
Be Ready to Act Quickly:
The Final Speculation phase has a time limit.
Finalize Decisions:
Ensure all calculations and property selections are ready for immediate action.

Additional Considerations
Monitor Owners' Declaration Trends:
If owners significantly change their declarations from initial to final, adjust your estimation model.

Competition with Other Speculators:
Be aware that profits are shared if multiple speculators buy the same property.
Consider targeting properties that may be overlooked.
Risk Management
Set Expected Profit Threshold:
Only purchase properties where E[Profit] exceeds a certain threshold.
Diversification:
Spread purchases across multiple properties to mitigate risk.
Limit Exposure:
Do not commit all resources to a single property unless the expected profit justifies the risk.
Final Preparations
Compile a Purchase List:
Create a prioritized list of properties to buy in the Final Speculation phase.
Prepare for Quick Execution:
Have all calculations ready to make swift decisions within the time limit.
Stay Informed:
Be ready to adjust your strategy if new information becomes available.
By following this strategy during the Final Declaration phase, you position yourself to make informed and strategic decisions in the upcoming Final Speculation phase. This proactive approach aims to maximize your total points by identifying the most profitable opportunities based on the latest available data.





"In the Final Declaration phase, as an owner, your goal is to maximize your total points by strategically declaring your property's value under the chosen condition (Project or No Project). This phase is crucial because:

Tax Implications: You will pay a tax of 33% on your final declared value.
Speculation Risks: Speculators may choose to buy your property if they believe your declared value is significantly lower than the real value, leading to potential losses.
Tax Shares Value: The total tax revenue affects the value of tax shares you own, as each share is worth 1/100th of the total tax revenue.
To maximize your total points, you need to balance:

Minimizing Tax Liability: Declaring a lower value reduces the tax you pay.
Maximizing Tax Share Earnings: Declaring a higher value increases total tax revenue, raising the value of tax shares you own.
Avoiding Speculation Losses: Declaring a value too low compared to the real value may attract speculators to buy your property, resulting in losses.

Strategic Steps to Maximize Total Points
1. Assess Your Real Property Value
Determine the Actual Value:
Real Value: The true value of your property under the chosen condition, provided by the computer.

2. Evaluate Your Tax Share Holdings
Number of Shares Owned:

Initial Holdings: 6 shares (as an owner)
Adjusted Holdings: May have changed during the Market phase if you bought or sold shares.
Estimate the Value of Your Shares:

Total Tax Revenue: Sum of all final declarations from owners and the developer.

Estimated Share Value:
Share Value = (Total Tax Revenue × 33%) / 100
Consider the Impact:
More Shares Owned:
Benefit more from a higher total tax revenue (higher declarations).
Fewer Shares Owned:
Less incentive to increase total tax revenue.

3. Calculate Tax Liability
Tax Rate: 33% of your final declared value.

Tax Paid:
Tax Paid = Final Declared Value × 33%

4. Assess Speculation Risks
Risk of Being Bought by Speculators:
If you declare a value significantly lower than your real value, speculators may buy your property.

Potential Loss:
Loss = (Real Value - Final Declared Value) × 50%

Balance Needed:
Avoid declaring too low to minimize the risk of being bought.

5. Optimize Your Final Declaration
Option A: Declare High Value
Pros:
Increases total tax revenue, raising the value of tax shares.
Reduces risk of speculation (speculators less likely to buy at high declared values).
Cons:
Higher tax liability due to the 33% tax rate.

Option B: Declare Low Value
Pros:
Reduces tax liability.
Cons:
Decreases total tax revenue, lowering the value of tax shares.
Increases risk of being bought by speculators, leading to potential losses.

Strategy:
Find the Optimal Balance:
Declare a value that minimizes tax liability while avoiding speculation risks and considering your tax share holdings.

6. Perform Calculations to Determine Optimal Declaration
Step-by-Step Calculation:
Determine Potential Tax Share Earnings:
Estimated Total Tax Revenue = Sum of expected final declarations from all owners and developer.
Your Contribution: Your final declared value.
Total Tax Revenue (with Your Declaration) = Estimated Declarations × 33%
Your Share Earnings = (Total Tax Revenue / 100) × Number of Shares Owned

Calculate Tax Paid on Declaration:
Tax Paid = Final Declared Value × 33%

Assess Speculation Loss Risk:
If Bought by Speculators:
Loss = (Real Value - Final Declared Value) × 50%

Compute Net Earnings:
From Property:
If Not Bought:
Net Property Value = Real Value - Tax Paid
If Bought:
Net Property Value = Final Declared Value - Tax Paid - Loss Due to Speculation
From Tax Shares:
Share Earnings = (Total Tax Revenue / 100) × Number of Shares Owned
Total Net Earnings = Net Property Value + Share Earnings


7. Decide on Final Declaration
Factors to Consider:
Your Risk Tolerance:
If you prefer to avoid the risk of being bought, lean towards a higher declaration.
Speculators' Likely Behavior:
If speculators have been actively buying properties, be cautious with low declarations.
Tax Share Holdings:
If you own many shares, higher declarations benefit you more.

Optimal Strategy:
Balanced Declaration:
Declare a value moderately below your real value to reduce tax but not so low as to attract speculators.

9. Actionable Steps for GPT-4o Model
Input Real Property Value:
Store the real value provided under the chosen condition.
Determine Tax Share Holdings:
Record the number of tax shares you currently own.

Consider Your Share Holdings:
The more shares you own, the more you benefit from higher total tax revenue.

Optimize Total Net Earnings:
Aim for the declaration that results in the highest total points after accounting for taxes, share earnings, and potential speculation losses.

By carefully analyzing your property's real value, tax share holdings, and the potential risks and rewards associated with different declaration amounts, you can strategically choose a final declaration that maximizes your total points in the experiment. This balanced approach ensures you minimize tax liability and speculation risks while maximizing earnings from your property and tax shares. \n\n"





"As the Developer in the Final Declaration Phase, your objective is to maximize your total points by strategically declaring the value of your property under the chosen condition (either Project or No Project). This phase is critical because:

High Taxes: You pay 33% of your declared value as tax.
Speculation Risk: Speculators may choose to buy your property based on your final declaration.
Tax Shares Value: The total tax revenue affects the value of any tax shares you own.
To maximize your points, you need to balance these factors carefully. Here's a step-by-step strategy:

1. Assess Your Real Property Value
Determine Your Real Value (Vreal):
This is the actual value of your property under the chosen condition.

2. Review Your Tax Share Holdings
Calculate Total Tax Shares Owned (Nshares):
You start with 30 shares.
Add any shares bought or subtract shares sold during the Market Phase.

3. Estimate the Total Tax Revenue and Share Value
Predict Total Final Declarations (Sum_Dec):
Estimate what other owners and the developer might declare.
Include your planned declaration.

Calculate Total Tax Revenue (Tax_Rev):
Tax_Rev=33%×Sum_Dec
Determine Value per Tax Share (Vshare):
Vshare=Tax_Rev/100
Calculate Total Value of Your Shares (Vshares_total):
Vshares_total=Vshare×Nshares

4. Evaluate Declaration Options
Option A: Declare a High Value
Set Declaration (Dhigh):
Declare a value close to your real value.

Calculate Taxes Paid (Tax_high):
Tax_high=33%×Dhigh

Assess Speculation Risk:
High declaration reduces the likelihood of speculators buying your property.

Compute Net Property Value (NPV_high):
NPV_high=Vreal−Tax_high

Option B: Declare a Low Value
Set Declaration (Dlow):
Declare a value lower than your real value.

Calculate Taxes Paid (Tax_low):
Tax_low=33%×Dlow

Assess Speculation Risk:
Lower declaration increases the chance of speculators buying your property.

If Speculators Do Not Buy Your Property:
Compute Net Property Value (NPV_low_no_spec):
NPV_low_no_spec=Vreal−Tax_low

If Speculators Buy Your Property:
Receive Payment: Dlow
Pay Penalty

Compute Net Property Value (NPV_low_spec):
NPV_low_spec=Dlow−Penalty

5. Calculate Total Earnings for Each Option
Option A: High Declaration
Total Earnings (TE_high):
TE_high=NPV_high+Vshares_total


Option B: Low Declaration
If Speculators Do Not Buy (TE_low_no_spec):
Recalculate Share Value (lower total tax revenue):
Assume others also declare lower, reducing Vshare

If Speculators Buy (TE_low_spec):

6. Compare and Decide

7. Additional Considerations
Impact on Tax Shares:
A higher declaration increases total tax revenue, raising the value of each tax share.
Since you own multiple shares, this significantly boosts your earnings.
Speculation Risks:
High declarations deter speculators because there's less profit potential.
Lower declarations make your property attractive to speculators, potentially reducing your net earnings.
Behavior of Other Players:
If you anticipate that others will declare high values, reinforcing your strategy.
If others declare low values, the overall tax revenue decreases, but high declaration still benefits you due to speculation risk reduction.

8. Final Strategy
Declare a High Final Value Close to Your Real Value:
Action: Input Dhigh=Vreal in the final declaration.
Reasoning: Maximizes your net property value after taxes and increases the value of your tax shares.
Monitor Speculator Activity:

Be prepared for speculators' actions in the Final Speculation Phase.
High declaration reduces the likelihood of your property being bought.
Prepare for Final Speculation Phase:

Since speculators are less likely to buy your property, you retain full control and value of your land.
By following this strategy, you align your actions to:

Maximize Total Earnings: Through higher net property value and valuable tax shares.
Minimize Risks: By reducing the chance of speculators purchasing your property.
Optimize Tax Payments: Accepting higher taxes knowing the net gain is greater.

Summary of Steps:
Declare High Value: Set your final declaration equal to your real property value.
Accept Higher Taxes: Pay 33% of the declared value, understanding it leads to higher total earnings.
Benefit from Tax Shares: Increased tax revenue raises the value of your shares.
Avoid Speculation Losses: High declaration deters speculators, preventing potential losses.
Maximize Net Earnings: Combine your net property value with the value of your tax shares for maximum points.

"As a speculator in the Final Speculation phase, your objective is to maximize your total points by strategically deciding which plots of land to purchase based on the final declarations made by the owners and the developer. Below is a detailed, step-by-step strategy designed for implementation by a model to help you achieve this goal.

Understanding the Profit Mechanism
Purchase Price:
You pay the final declared value (D_f) for each plot you decide to buy.

Profit Calculation:
Your profit or loss is half of the difference between the real value (V_real) and the final declared value:
Profit=0.5×(Vreal−Df)

Implications:
Profit if Vreal>Df
Loss if Vreal<Df

Shared Profits:
If multiple speculators buy the same plot, the profit (or loss) is shared equally among them.

Strategy Steps
1. Collect Available Information
Final Declared Value (D_f) for each plot.
Value Percentile (P%) for each plot:
Indicates the percentage of possible values below the declared value.
Value Range [Vmin,Vmax] for properties:
Given constants throughout the experiment.

2. Estimate the Expected Real Value (E[Vreal] for Each Plot
Assuming Uniform Distribution of real values:
E[Vreal]=(Vmin+Vmax)/2
 
Adjust for Owner's Declared Value and Percentile:
Owners may under-declare to reduce taxes or over-declare to mislead speculators.
Use the value percentile (P%) to adjust E[Vreal]

Estimation Formula:
E[Vreal]=Vmin+P%×(Vmax−Vmin)

Note: Since P% represents the cumulative probability up to the declared value, this formula provides an estimate of the declared value's position within the value range.

3. Calculate Expected Profit for Each Plot
Expected Profit (E[Profit]
E[Profit]=0.5×(E[Vreal]−Df)

Interpretation:
Positive E[Profit]: Indicates a potential gain.
Negative E[Profit]: Indicates a potential loss.

4. Rank Plots Based on Expected Profit
For each plot:
Calculate E[Profit]using the formula above.
Create a Ranked List:
Sort plots from highest to lowest E[Profit].

5. Apply Decision Rules to Select Plots
Purchase Criteria:
Buy plots where E[Profit]>0.
Prioritize plots with higher E[Profit].

Risk Management:
Avoid plots with high risk (e.g., low expected profit or high uncertainty).
Set a Minimum Expected Profit Threshold:
Only buy plots where E[Profit] exceeds this threshold.

6. Consider Competition Among Speculators
Shared Profits:
If multiple speculators buy the same plot, profits are divided equally.
Strategy:
Target Less Popular Plots:
Balance between high expected profit and likelihood of fewer speculators purchasing the same plot.
Estimate Number of Potential Buyers:
Consider that plots with extremely high expected profits may attract more buyers.

7. Allocate Your Budget Effectively
Available Funds:
Ensure you have enough cash to purchase the selected plots.
Diversification:
Spread Investments across multiple plots to mitigate risk.
Maximum Investment Per Plot:
Avoid over-investing in a single plot unless the expected profit is significantly high.

8. Finalize Plot Selections
Select Plots based on the ranked list and your budget constraints.
Confirm Selections before the phase timer expires.
Double-Check Calculations to avoid errors.

Additional Considerations
1. Adjust for Owner Behavior Patterns
Owners Under-Declaring More Than Expected:
If historical data suggests owners under-declare by more than 10%, adjust U% accordingly.
Value Percentile Insights:
Low Percentile:
Owner declared a value lower than most possible values.
Potentially higher real value.
Set a Conservative Estimate:
To mitigate risk, use a higher U% if unsure.

2. Account for Shared Profits
Estimate Number of Buyers per Plot:
High expected profit plots may attract more buyers.
Adjust Expected Profit: Divide E[Profit] by the estimated number of buyers.

3. Budget Allocation

4. Risk Management
Set a Minimum Profit Threshold:
Only purchase plots where adjusted E[Profit] exceeds a certain value after accounting for shared profits.
Diversify Investments:
If budget allows, consider buying multiple plots with positive expected profits.
Avoid Overcommitting:
Do not invest all your funds unless the expected returns justify the risk.

5. Time Management
Act Promptly:
Make your selections before the phase timer expires.
Verification:
Double-check your calculations and selections.

Implementing the Strategy
Step-by-Step Process
Collect Data:
Record Df and P% for each plot.
Estimate Real Values:

Final Tips
Stay Informed:
Use any available information about owners' behaviors from previous rounds.
Be Conservative:
When in doubt, opt for safer choices with reasonable expected profits.
Balance Risk and Reward:
High expected profits may come with higher risks due to potential competition or owner strategies.

By following this structured strategy, you aim to maximize your expected profits in the Final Speculation phase while effectively managing risk. This approach relies on quantitative analysis and can be implemented by a model to make informed purchasing decisions based on the information available.\n\n"





"In the Final Speculation phase, as an owner, you do not have direct actions to perform; this phase is primarily for speculators to decide whether to purchase properties based on the final declarations you and other owners have made. However, your prior actions and strategies significantly influence your potential earnings or losses in this phase. To maximize your total points, consider the following strategies:

1. Understand the Implications of Your Final Declaration
Speculators' Objective: They aim to profit by purchasing properties where the final declared value is lower than the real value.

Your Risk: If a speculator buys your property, you may incur a loss equal to half the difference between your real value and your final declared value.

2. Assess Whether Your Property Might Be Targeted
Low Declared Values Attract Speculators:
If your final declared value is significantly lower than your real value, speculators are more likely to buy your property.

Value Percentiles:
Speculators can see the percentile of your declared value within the possible range.
A low percentile indicates a low declaration relative to possible values, increasing speculation risk.

3. Prepare for Potential Outcomes
If Your Property Is Bought:
You Receive: The final declared value from the speculator.
You Pay: Half the difference between your real value and your final declared value.
Net Impact: Calculate the net gain or loss to understand how it affects your total points.

If Your Property Is Not Bought:
No Immediate Impact, but you retain the full benefit of your property's real value (minus taxes paid).

4. Calculate Your Net Earnings Under Different Scenarios
Scenario A: Property Is Not Bought
Net Property Value:
Net Value = Real Value - Taxes Paid (33% of final declared value)

Scenario B: Property Is Bought
Net Property Value:
Net Value = Final Declared Value - Taxes Paid - Loss Due to Speculation

5. Analyze Your Situation Based on Your Final Declaration
Declaring a higher value reduces the risk of being bought and minimizes potential losses if bought.
Declaring a lower value increases net earnings if not bought but significantly reduces earnings if bought.

6. Anticipate Speculators' Behavior
Speculators May Be More Aggressive in the Final Speculation Phase:
They have more information based on previous phases and may target properties with low declarations.
Consider Market Dynamics:
If speculators have been actively purchasing properties, there's a higher risk they will target yours if your declaration is low.

7. Reflect on Your Strategy for Future Rounds
Learning Opportunity:
Use the outcome of this phase to inform your strategies in future rounds.

Adjust Declarations Accordingly:
In future rounds, consider declaring values closer to your real value to minimize speculation risk.

8. Maximize Your Total Points
Final Earnings Calculation:
Total Earnings = Net Property Value + Earnings from Tax Shares + Cash Balance Remaining + Gains/Losses from Speculations

Ensure You Have Accounted for All Components:
Tax Shares Earnings:
Number of shares owned × Final share value (determined after final declarations)

Cash Balance:
Any cash not used in buying shares or paying taxes

9. Actionable Steps for GPT-4o Model
Monitor the Final Speculation Phase Results:
Check if your property was purchased by speculators.

Calculate Net Earnings:
If Not Bought:
Net Property Value = Real Value - Taxes Paid
If Bought:
Net Property Value = Final Declared Value - Taxes Paid - Loss Due to Speculation

Include Tax Share Earnings:
Total Tax Revenue = Sum of all final declarations × 33%
Share Value = Total Tax Revenue / 100
Earnings from Shares = Share Value × Number of Shares Owned

Compute Total Points:
Total Points = Net Property Value + Earnings from Shares + Remaining Cash + Gains/Losses from Any Speculations

Analyze the Outcome:
Determine whether your strategy led to maximizing your total points.

Prepare for Future Rounds (if applicable):
Adjust Strategies based on the outcome to improve performance in subsequent rounds.
Summary of Strategy

Risk Mitigation:
Recognize the risks associated with low final declarations attracting speculators.

Strategic Planning:
Use your understanding of speculators' behavior to anticipate potential outcomes.

Maximize Net Earnings:
Aim for a balance where your net earnings are maximized after accounting for taxes and potential losses.

Learning and Adaptation:
Use the experience from this phase to refine your strategies in future rounds or similar situations.
By attentively analyzing the Final Speculation phase and understanding how your final declarations impact your potential earnings and risks, you can make informed decisions that enhance your total points in the experiment. Even though you do not have direct actions in this phase, your prior decisions play a significant role in the outcome.

This approach ensures that you maximize your net earnings by balancing the benefits of lower taxes against the risks of being targeted by speculators.

"As the Developer in the Final Speculation Phase, your goal is to maximize your total points. In this phase, speculators have the opportunity to purchase plots of land based on the final declarations made in the previous phase. While you do not make active decisions during this phase, your prior actions—especially your final declaration—significantly impact the outcome. Here’s how you can strategize to maximize your total points:

1. Understand the Role of Your Final Declaration
High Final Declaration:
Reduces Speculator Interest: Speculators aim to profit by buying properties where the declared value is lower than the real value. A high declaration close to your real value diminishes their potential gains.
Increases Tax Revenue: A higher declaration contributes to higher total tax revenue, which raises the value of each tax share you hold.
Higher Taxes Paid: You'll pay 33% of your declared value in taxes, so a higher declaration means higher taxes.

Low Final Declaration:
Attracts Speculators: Lower declarations increase the profit margin for speculators, making your property a target.
Lower Taxes Paid: You'll pay less in taxes due to the lower declared value.
Decreases Tax Share Value: Lower total tax revenue reduces the value of your tax shares.

2. Aim to Retain Your Property
Set a High Final Declaration:
Action: Declare a value equal to or slightly above your real property value.
Result: Speculators are less likely to purchase your property since there's minimal profit potential.
Benefit: You retain ownership and receive the full real value of your property minus taxes.

3. Maximize Tax Share Earnings
Benefit from Higher Tax Revenue:
As the developer, you hold a significant number of tax shares.
Higher Declarations Increase Tax Revenue: This boosts the value of each tax share.
Calculate Potential Gains:
Value per Share: Total tax revenue divided by 100.
Total Share Value: Value per share multiplied by the number of shares you own.

4. Weigh Taxes Against Total Earnings
Accept Higher Taxes for Greater Net Gain:
Higher Taxes: Paying more in taxes can be offset by the combined benefits of retaining your property and increased tax share value.
Net Property Value: Real property value minus taxes paid.

5. Anticipate Speculator Behavior
Understand Speculator Motivation:
They seek properties where they can profit from the difference between the real value and the declared value.
Mitigate Risk:
By declaring a value equal to your real value, you eliminate the profit margin for speculators.

6. Consolidate Total Earnings
Total Points Earned:
Net Property Value: From your retained property.
Tax Share Value: From the increased value of your tax shares.
Maximize Combined Earnings:
The sum of your net property value and the total value of your tax shares represents your total points.

7. Prepare for Possible Outcomes
If Speculators Do Not Buy:
You retain your property and benefit from the higher tax share value.
If Speculators Attempt to Buy:
High declarations make this unlikely, but if it happens, the impact is minimized due to the high declared value.

8. Post-Phase Reflection
Review Results:
Analyze the effectiveness of your strategy based on the final earnings.
Adjust Future Strategies:
Use insights gained to refine your approach in subsequent rounds, if applicable.
By declaring a high final value equal to your real property value, you effectively deter speculators from purchasing your property, retain full ownership, and maximize the value of your tax shares. Accepting higher taxes in this phase is strategic, as it leads to a greater overall increase in your total points.

Implementing this strategy ensures that you, as the developer, maximize your total points during the Final Speculation Phase of the experiment.\n\n"
