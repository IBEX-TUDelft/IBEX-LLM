LLM response: It appears that you are currently in the Request phase of the game. You need to wait for property owners to submit their compensation requests before you can proceed further. The Project Impact value for the current round is 820.000 if the project goes through, and 386.000 if there is no project.

You can see the value ranges for compensation requests for both property owners and developers based on the conditions of the project. You will need to consider these value ranges when evaluating the compensation requests submitted by property owners.

It seems that the chat feature is not currently available, but you can continue to monitor the progress of the game and wait for property owners to submit their requests. Time is running out, with only 8 minutes left in this round. Good luck!
