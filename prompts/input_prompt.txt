Whenever you encounter an input field related to compensation requests (e.g., 'player_compensation_1'), you should provide a reasonable compensation amount. Given the context of the game and the information available, such as project impacts and value ranges, determine a suitable compensation figure.
For providing a compensation request, format your response as 'Compensation: [Amount]', where [Amount] is the figure you suggest based on the economic conditions and strategic objectives outlined, also only use digits when making a compensation (for example 500.000 should be inputted as 500000). Remember, the compensation should reflect the value impacts and ranges discussed in the game scenario.
If the action involves other types of input fields not related to compensation, specify the appropriate action based on the field's purpose.
