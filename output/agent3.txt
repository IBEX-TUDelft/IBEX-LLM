The signals represent market data, and you should interpret them to determine whether you wish to post a buy (bid) or sell (ask) order.

Market Signals:
- 'signals': Your private signals, visible only to you
- 'publicSignal': Signals visible to all players
Use this data to inform your decision. You are responsible for setting the prices based on these signals.

**You must ensure that the 'price' in your order does not exceed your available balance.**

Simulation Events Summary:
Current Phase (6): Market Phase: Players now see their private signals and the public signals. Use these signals to decide your next trading move.

**Your available balance is 78800. You cannot place a bid or ask that exceeds this amount.**

The signals represent market data, and you should interpret them to determine whether you wish to post a buy (bid) or sell (ask) order.

Market Signals:
- 'signals': Your private signals, visible only to you
- 'publicSignal': Signals visible to all players
Use this data to inform your decision. You are responsible for setting the prices based on these signals.

**You must ensure that the 'price' in your order does not exceed your available balance.**

Current Phase (6): Market Phase: Players now see their private signals and the public signals. Use these signals to decide your next trading move.

**Your available balance is 88900. You cannot place a bid or ask that exceeds this amount.**

The signals represent market data, and you should interpret them to determine whether you wish to post a buy (bid) or sell (ask) order.

Market Signals:
- 'signals': Your private signals, visible only to you
- 'publicSignal': Signals visible to all players
Use this data to inform your decision. You are responsible for setting the prices based on these signals.

**You must ensure that the 'price' in your order does not exceed your available balance.**

Simulation Events Summary:
Current Phase (6): Market Phase: Players now see their private signals and the public signals. Use these signals to decide your next trading move.

**Your available balance is 88900. You cannot place a bid or ask that exceeds this amount.**

The signals represent market data, and you should interpret them to determine whether you wish to post a buy (bid) or sell (ask) order.

Market Signals:
- 'signals': Your private signals, visible only to you
- 'publicSignal': Signals visible to all players
Use this data to inform your decision. You are responsible for setting the prices based on these signals.

**You must ensure that the 'price' in your order does not exceed your available balance.**

    "type": "post-order",
    "order": {
        "price": your_chosen_price if 1 <= your_chosen_price <= 88900,  # Integer, price you decide based on signals, limited to range 1-88900

Current Phase (6): Market Phase: Players now see their private signals and the public signals. Use these signals to decide your next trading move.

**Your available balance is 88900. You cannot place a bid or ask that exceeds this amount.**

The signals represent market data, and you should interpret them to determine whether you wish to post a buy (bid) or sell (ask) order.

Market Signals:
- 'signals': Your private signals, visible only to you
- 'publicSignal': Signals visible to all players
Use this data to inform your decision. You are responsible for setting the prices based on these signals.

**You must ensure that the 'price' in your order does not exceed your available balance.**

Current Phase (6): Market Phase: Players now see their private signals and the public signals. Use these signals to decide your next trading move.

**Your available balance is 78900. You cannot place a bid or ask that exceeds this amount.**

The signals represent market data, and you should interpret them to determine whether you wish to post a buy (bid) or sell (ask) order.

Market Signals:
- 'signals': Your private signals, visible only to you
- 'publicSignal': Signals visible to all players
Use this data to inform your decision. You are responsible for setting the prices based on these signals.

**You must ensure that the 'price' in your order does not exceed your available balance.**

Current Phase (6): Market Phase: Players now see their private signals and the public signals. Use these signals to decide your next trading move.

**Your available balance is 78900. You cannot place a bid or ask that exceeds this amount.**

The signals represent market data, and you should interpret them to determine whether you wish to post a buy (bid) or sell (ask) order.

Market Signals:
- 'signals': Your private signals, visible only to you
- 'publicSignal': Signals visible to all players
Use this data to inform your decision. You are responsible for setting the prices based on these signals.

**You must ensure that the 'price' in your order does not exceed your available balance.**

Current Phase (6): Market Phase: Players now see their private signals and the public signals. Use these signals to decide your next trading move.

**Your available balance is 99500. You cannot place a bid or ask that exceeds this amount.**

The signals represent market data, and you should interpret them to determine whether you wish to post a buy (bid) or sell (ask) order.

Market Signals:
- 'signals': Your private signals, visible only to you
- 'publicSignal': Signals visible to all players
Use this data to inform your decision. You are responsible for setting the prices based on these signals.

**You must ensure that the 'price' in your order does not exceed your available balance.**

Expected JSON Output (Post Order):

Current Phase (6): Market Phase: Players now see their private signals and the public signals. Use these signals to decide your next trading move.

**Your available balance is 89325. You cannot place a bid or ask that exceeds this amount.**

The signals represent market data, and you should interpret them to determine whether you wish to post a buy (bid) or sell (ask) order.

Market Signals:
- 'signals': Your private signals, visible only to you
- 'publicSignal': Signals visible to all players
Use this data to inform your decision. You are responsible for setting the prices based on these signals.

**You must ensure that the 'price' in your order does not exceed your available balance.**

Current Phase (6): Market Phase: Players now see their private signals and the public signals. Use these signals to decide your next trading move.

**Your available balance is 99500. You cannot place a bid or ask that exceeds this amount.**

The signals represent market data, and you should interpret them to determine whether you wish to post a buy (bid) or sell (ask) order.

Market Signals:
- 'signals': Your private signals, visible only to you
- 'publicSignal': Signals visible to all players
Use this data to inform your decision. You are responsible for setting the prices based on these signals.

**You must ensure that the 'price' in your order does not exceed your available balance.**

Current Phase (6): Market Phase: Players now see their private signals and the public signals. Use these signals to decide your next trading move.

**Your available balance is 99450. You cannot place a bid or ask that exceeds this amount.**

The signals represent market data, and you should interpret them to determine whether you wish to post a buy (bid) or sell (ask) order.

Market Signals:
- 'signals': Your private signals, visible only to you
- 'publicSignal': Signals visible to all players
Use this data to inform your decision. You are responsible for setting the prices based on these signals.

**You must ensure that the 'price' in your order does not exceed your available balance.**

Current Phase (6): Market Phase: Players now see their private signals and the public signals. Use these signals to decide your next trading move.

**Your available balance is 109450. You cannot place a bid or ask that exceeds this amount.**

The signals represent market data, and you should interpret them to determine whether you wish to post a buy (bid) or sell (ask) order.

Market Signals:
- 'signals': Your private signals, visible only to you
- 'publicSignal': Signals visible to all players
Use this data to inform your decision. You are responsible for setting the prices based on these signals.

**You must ensure that the 'price' in your order does not exceed your available balance.**

The signals represent market data, and you should interpret them to determine whether you wish to post a buy (bid) or sell (ask) order.

Market Signals:
- 'signals': Your private signals, visible only to you
- 'publicSignal': Signals visible to all players
Use this data to inform your decision. You are responsible for setting the prices based on these signals.

**You must ensure that the 'price' in your order does not exceed your available balance.**

Current Phase (6): Market Phase: Players now see their private signals and the public signals. Use these signals to decide your next trading move.

**Your available balance is 109450. You cannot place a bid or ask that exceeds this amount.**

The signals represent market data, and you should interpret them to determine whether you wish to post a buy (bid) or sell (ask) order.

Market Signals:
- 'signals': Your private signals, visible only to you
- 'publicSignal': Signals visible to all players
Use this data to inform your decision. You are responsible for setting the prices based on these signals.

**You must ensure that the 'price' in your order does not exceed your available balance.**

        "price": your_chosen_price if 1 <= your_chosen_price <= 109450,  # Integer, price you decide based on signals, limited to range 1-109450

Current Phase (6): Market Phase: Players now see their private signals and the public signals. Use these signals to decide your next trading move.

**Your available balance is 109450. You cannot place a bid or ask that exceeds this amount.**

The signals represent market data, and you should interpret them to determine whether you wish to post a buy (bid) or sell (ask) order.

Market Signals:
- 'signals': Your private signals, visible only to you
- 'publicSignal': Signals visible to all players
Use this data to inform your decision. You are responsible for setting the prices based on these signals.

**You must ensure that the 'price' in your order does not exceed your available balance.**

        "price": your_chosen_price if 1 <= your_chosen_price <= 109450,  # Integer, price you decide based on signals, limited to range 1-109450

Current Phase (6): Market Phase: Players now see their private signals and the public signals. Use these signals to decide your next trading move.

**Your available balance is 109450. You cannot place a bid or ask that exceeds this amount.**

The signals represent market data, and you should interpret them to determine whether you wish to post a buy (bid) or sell (ask) order.

Market Signals:
- 'signals': Your private signals, visible only to you
- 'publicSignal': Signals visible to all players
Use this data to inform your decision. You are responsible for setting the prices based on these signals.

**You must ensure that the 'price' in your order does not exceed your available balance.**

Expected JSON Output (Post Order):

    "type": "post-order",
    "order": {
        "price": your_chosen_price if 1 <= your_chosen_price <= 109450,  # Integer, price you decide based on signals, limited to range 1-109450
        "quantity": 1,                # Integer, always 1
        "condition": condition_number,  # Integer, 0 for status quo, 1 for project

Simulation Events Summary:
Current Phase (6): Market Phase: Players now see their private signals and the public signals. Use these signals to decide your next trading move.

**Your available balance is 109450. You cannot place a bid or ask that exceeds this amount.**

The signals represent market data, and you should interpret them to determine whether you wish to post a buy (bid) or sell (ask) order.

Market Signals:

Current Phase (6): Market Phase: Players now see their private signals and the public signals. Use these signals to decide your next trading move.

**Your available balance is 109450. You cannot place a bid or ask that exceeds this amount.**

The signals represent market data, and you should interpret them to determine whether you wish to post a buy (bid) or sell (ask) order.

Market Signals:
- 'signals': Your private signals, visible only to you
- 'publicSignal': Signals visible to all players
Use this data to inform your decision. You are responsible for setting the prices based on these signals.

**You must ensure that the 'price' in your order does not exceed your available balance.**

    "type": "post-order",
    "order": {
        "price": your_chosen_price if 1 <= your_chosen_price <= 109450,  # Integer, price you decide based on signals, limited to range 1-109450

Current Phase (6): Market Phase: Players now see their private signals and the public signals. Use these signals to decide your next trading move.

**Your available balance is 109450. You cannot place a bid or ask that exceeds this amount.**

The signals represent market data, and you should interpret them to determine whether you wish to post a buy (bid) or sell (ask) order.

Market Signals:
- 'signals': Your private signals, visible only to you
- 'publicSignal': Signals visible to all players
Use this data to inform your decision. You are responsible for setting the prices based on these signals.

**You must ensure that the 'price' in your order does not exceed your available balance.**

        "price": your_chosen_price if 1 <= your_chosen_price <= 109450,  # Integer, price you decide based on signals, limited to range 1-109450
