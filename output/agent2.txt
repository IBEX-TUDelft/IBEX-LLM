The signals represent market data, and you should interpret them to determine whether you wish to post a buy (bid) or sell (ask) order.

Market Signals:
- 'signals': Your private signals, visible only to you
- 'publicSignal': Signals visible to all players
Use this data to inform your decision. You are responsible for setting the prices based on these signals.
