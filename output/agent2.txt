Current Phase (6): Market Phase: Players now see their private signals and the public signals. Use these signals to decide your next trading move, so don't exceed the market signals.

The signals represent market data, and you should interpret them to determine whether you wish to post a buy (bid) or sell (ask) order.

Market Signals:
- 'signals': Your private signals, visible only to you
- 'publicSignal': Signals visible to all players
Use this data to inform your decision. You are responsible for setting the prices based on these signals.
