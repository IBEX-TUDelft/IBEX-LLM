Querying OpenAI for event: add-order with prompt: A new order has been added with price 5 and quantity 1. How should the market react?
OpenAI Response: The market may react in various ways to this new order. 

1. If the price of 5 is significantly lower than the current market price, it may cause a drop in the overall price as sellers lower their prices to match the new order.
