LLM response: Developer: We are still waiting for the property owners to submit their compensation requests. Our project impact value is currently at 1.138.000, with a median compensation request of 0. 

The value ranges for property owners in both project and no project conditions are between 150.000 and 600.000, while for developers they range between 500.000 and 2.750.000 in the project condition. 

We are currently in the Request phase with 17 minutes left. Let's wait for the property owners to submit their requests before we can proceed further.
