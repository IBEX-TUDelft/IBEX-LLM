To provide a compensation request, use the input field and format your response as 'Compensation: [Amount]'. Make sure to consider the project impacts and value ranges discussed in the game scenario when determining the suitable compensation figure. Press the submission button (e.g. 'Submit') to process the entered amount, then confirm the submission by pressing 'Submit Your Compensation Request' followed by 'Submit' for the final confirmation. Follow the steps in the correct order to complete the submission process.

LLM response: It seems that there are no buttons available to make any decisions or actions in this current round. 

In this phase of the simulation, you are waiting for property owners to submit their compensation requests. Time is running out, so you will need to wait for their submissions before you can proceed to the next phase. 

Keep an eye on the values and conditions provided, as they will inform your decisions once the compensation requests are received. Good luck in the upcoming rounds of the simulation!

LLM response: Developer: We need to wait for property owners to submit their compensation requests before we can proceed. The project impact for this round is 1.138.000, significantly higher than if there were no project at all. Remember, your property is highlighted in blue on the map.

Owner 1's compensation request for this round is still pending. As the developer, your median request is currently set at 0.

The value ranges for owners in different conditions are between 350.000 and 600.000 for no project, and between 150.000 and 350.000 for the project. For developers, the value ranges are 200.000 to 500.000 for no project, and 500.000 to 2.750.000 for the project.

Stay tuned for updates as we wait for property owners to finalize their compensation requests.
