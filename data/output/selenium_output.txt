LLM response: It looks like the round is about to start and all the players are ready. The phase is in the Presentation stage where each player will present their neighborhoods with their respective property highlighted in blue.

The value ranges for both the owner and developer are listed based on whether there is a project in place or not. The minimum and maximum values for each condition are provided for reference.

Currently, the round is in the Presentation phase and the winning condition and votes for the project are yet to be determined. There are no buttons found at the moment, so the players will have to wait for the results to be calculated. Good luck!
