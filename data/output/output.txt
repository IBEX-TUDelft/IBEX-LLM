Phase Transitioned to Phase 2: Declaration Phase: Each player owning a property must declare the expected revenue for the round. The declaration should be an array, with the first two items representing the revenue under different conditions (status quo and project development). The third item, although initially intended for a different project, should be set to 0.

Phase Transitioned to Phase 3: Speculation Phase: At this stage in Futarchy, speculators may challenge declarations by property owners if they believe the declared revenue is underestimated. This is done by submitting an array of arrays where each sub-array corresponds to a condition and lists the owners being challenged. A penalty is applied based on whether the declaration was below or above the expected revenue.

Expected JSON Output:
```json

    "content": {

ERROR:root:Failed to decode JSON: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0) - Response text: Based on the provided events and the declared values, let's examine the declarations and decide whether or not to challenge any of them.

Here is the data we have:
- Dreadful Pig Lot, declared value: 350,000 (Violet)
- Missing Lemur Lot, declared value: 200,000 (Aqua)

For simplicity, let's assume that we have reason to believe that both these properties might have an understated declared value. We'll challenge both properties.

```json
{
    "content": {
        "gameId": 354,
        "type": "done-speculating",
        "snipe": [
            [1],  // Challenge the declaration for Dreadful Pig Lot
            [2]   // Challenge the declaration for Missing Lemur Lot
        ]
    },
    "number": 1,
    "tag": "Participant",
    "phase": 3,
    "round": 1,
    "type": "message"
}
```

In this JSON response:
- `"snipe": [[1], [2]]` signifies that both properties are being challenged.
- All other fields match the expected format and current context details.

Phase Transitioned to Phase 6: Market Phase: During this phase, players can post and cancel orders in two parallel markets, one for each condition: 0 (status quo) and 1 (development of the project). Players may buy (bid) or sell (ask) shares of the social revenue associated with each condition. The condition, price, quantity, and type (ask or bid) must be specified for each order. The 'now' parameter allows orders to be executed immediately at the best available price if set to true.

Expected JSON Output (Post Order):
```json
{
    "content": {
        "order": {
            "price": 3560,
            "quantity": 1,

ERROR:root:Failed to decode JSON: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0) - Response text: Based on the provided simulation events and current phase (Market Phase), the appropriate action is to post an order. Given the signals and conditions, let's create a bid order for condition 1.

Here's the JSON output:

```json
{
    "content": {
        "order": {
            "price": 5000,
            "quantity": 1,

    "number": 1,
    "tag": "Participant",
    "phase": 6,

This response indicates a bid order for condition 1 at a price of 5000 for 1 unit, to be executed later.

ERROR:root:Failed to decode JSON: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0) - Response text: Based on the summary of events and the current phase (Market Phase), it is appropriate to post an order. Here's an example of posting an order to sell shares of the social revenue associated with condition 0 (status quo):

```json
{
    "content": {
        "order": {
            "price": 3560,

    "number": 1,
    "tag": "Participant",
    "phase": 6,

```

This JSON output specifies that I am posting an order to sell 1 share at a price of 3560 for condition 0. The order is not set to execute immediately as indicated by `"now": false`.
