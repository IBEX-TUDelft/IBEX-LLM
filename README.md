# Project Overview

This project introduces an approach to automating economic experiments by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs). It uses OpenAI's API to create a multi-actor simulation environment where different LLM agents act as economic entities with distinct roles, preferences, and information. This setup aims to mimic complex economic scenarios within a digital platform, enabling efficient and ethical experimentation on a wide range of economic theories and institutional designs.

### Project Goals: Enhancing LLM Agent Reasoning in Economic Experiments
#### Note: These objectives evolve over time but are kept here for reference.

The project aims to improve the reasoning abilities of LLMs as agents in economic experiments, focusing on these key objectives:

#### 1. **Refine Instruction Parsing**
- **Goal:** Develop a more sophisticated parsing process that accurately interprets and summarizes complex instructions, ensuring LLM agents receive a rich, contextual understanding of their tasks.
- **Approach:** Enhance the summarization pipeline to preserve essential context and integrate clues that aid in understanding the broader economic scenarios.

#### 2. **Expand Context with Advanced Techniques**
- **Goal:** Utilize advanced machine learning techniques and dynamic prompting to enrich the context available to LLM agents, improving their decision-making in complex scenarios.
- **Approach:** Implement dynamic prompting strategies, integrate external knowledge bases, and explore ML models that specialize in context retention and understanding.

**Expected Outcome:** These improvements aim to make LLM agentsâ€™ reasoning more sophisticated and human-like, enhancing the fidelity of economic experiments and opening new avenues for economic research.

## Architecture Overview

## ðŸ“Œ LLM Agent Integration Overview
Initially, the LLM agent is briefed using the same document provided to human subjects. The `instructionReader.py` script processes these documents by parsing, converting them to JSON format, and summarizing the content.

### Instruction Format

The instructions for the LLM agent are encapsulated in JSON format, including the project phases, such as requests, offers, and voting.

### Game Introduction Instructions

At the game's start, the LLM agent receives instructions defining how to respond to different events, ensuring a smooth integration and participation process.

### Action Required Message Example

An example message illustrates how the LLM agent receives detailed instructions for taking action, emphasizing the importance of precision and timeliness.

### Dynamic Scenario Simulation

Agents are dynamically assigned roles and objectives based on the specific economic theory or institutional design being tested. Each simulation can explore different facets of economic behavior, from market speculation to resource allocation, in a controlled yet complex virtual environment.
